            <h3>Site Map</h3>
            <p>
                A site map is a list of pages that are contained within a website. Generally all the pages on the website are listed on the site map so they can redirect a user to a certain page. We also want to list our pages on a site map because it makes it easier for web crawlers to crawl our pages and increase our search rankings.

            <h3>Navigation menu</h3>
            <p>
                A naviagation menu is a menu that allows you to navigate to different parts of a website. Unlike a site map not all pages may be cointained in a navigation menu. For example, if a user registers on a website and then gets redirected to a thank you page, the thank you page would be contained in the site map but not in the navigation menu because that's not a page you want your users to be able to reach unless they performed some actions (like registering) before that. The navigation usually contains a link back to the home page and the main pages of the website.
